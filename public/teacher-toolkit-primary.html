    <h2>Overview (1 page)</h2>
    <p>This toolkit gives teachers three short lessons suitable for ages 8–11. Each lesson is activity-led and emphasises critical thinking, ethics, and simple technical intuition—not coding.</p>

    <h2>Lesson 1 — What is AI? (30–45 minutes)</h2>
    <div class="lesson">
      <h3>Learning goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand that "AI" means systems that make decisions from data or rules.</li>
        <li>Give examples of everyday AI (recommendations, voice assistants, simple filters).</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Materials</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Printed card pack: pictures & descriptions (provided below)</li>
        <li>Whiteboard / flipchart</li>

      </div>
      <h3>Activity</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Show students images or examples and ask: "Is this an example of AI?" Discuss.</li>
        <li>Group work: match pictures to simple descriptions (e.g., "recommends videos", "recognises faces").</li>
        <li>Wrap-up: Write one sentence about where students have seen these tools in their daily lives.</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Teacher notes</h3>
      <p class="notes">Keep definitions short and concrete. Focus on cause/effect rather than technical details. Emphasise that AI is built by people and can be improved.</p>

    <h2>Lesson 2 — Data & Bias (30–45 minutes)</h2>
    <div class="lesson">
      <h3>Learning goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Understand that AI systems learn from examples (data).</li>
        <li>Recognise that if data is unbalanced, outputs can be unfair.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Activity</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Show two short stories about an automated decision; ask students which feels fair and why.</li>
        <li>Class experiment: use token sets (coloured balls) to demonstrate sampling and how results change. See detailed teacher instructions below.</li>
        <li>Discuss: how would we check an AI system to make sure it is fair?</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Teacher notes</h3>
      <p class="notes">Avoid complex statistics—use concrete visual metaphors. Reassure students that being critical of technology is a positive skill.</p>

      <h4 class="mt-3">Class experiment — step-by-step (teacher script)</h4>
      <div class="lesson">
        <h5>Goal</h5>
        <p>Show how different samples of data can change the behaviour of a system and why it matters for fairness.</p>

        <h5>Materials</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Two or three sets of coloured tokens (e.g., ping-pong balls, counters, or printed tokens). Choose contrasting colours like red/blue/green. ~30 tokens per set works well.</li>
          <li>Two opaque bags or boxes to draw tokens from (or use a covered hat).</li>
          <li>Whiteboard and marker to record results.</li>
          <li>Optional: sticky notes to label groups or counters on the board.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Setup</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Prepare two bags with different mixes of tokens. Example: Bag A = 20 red, 10 blue; Bag B = 10 red, 20 blue. (Red = outcome X, Blue = outcome Y.)</li>
          <li>Explain that an 'automatic system' will make a decision by randomly sampling a token from a bag and using the token colour as the output.</li>
          <li>Split the class into small teams (3–5 students) to collect samples and record observations.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Script (what to say)</h5>
        <p>"Today we'll pretend a computer makes decisions by looking at past examples. Imagine the tokens show what the system usually saw before. We'll draw tokens to see how the system behaves."</p>
        <p>"Team 1 will draw 10 tokens from Bag A and count how many reds and blues they get. Team 2 will do the same with Bag B. We'll compare results."</p>

        <h5>Run the experiment</h5>
        <ol>
          <li>Each team draws 10 tokens at random from their assigned bag and records counts (red vs blue).</li>
          <li>Collect the team results on the board and calculate totals and proportions (e.g., 7/10 red = 70% red).</li>
          <li>Repeat the draw a couple of times (different students) to show variation between samples.</li>
        </ol>

        <h5>Expected observations to highlight</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Bag A tends to produce more red; Bag B tends to produce more blue — this shows how the underlying data influences outputs.</li>
          <li>Different draws (samples) vary — even from the same bag you may get different counts; randomness matters.</li>
          <li>A small sample may be misleading; larger samples reduce random variation.</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Discussion prompts (for non-technical teachers)</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>What does each bag represent in real life? (e.g., past decisions, user data, historical records)</li>
          <li>If a computer learned only from Bag A history, what decisions might it make more often? Would that be fair for everyone?</li>
          <li>How could we check if a real system is biased? (Look at examples it makes mistakes on, compare results for different groups.)</li>
          <li>What would you change in the system to make it fairer? (Collect better data, add human checks, monitor performance regularly.)</li>
        </ul>

        <h5>Teacher tips</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Keep language simple: use 'examples' instead of 'training data' when addressing younger students.</li>
          <li>Use concrete analogies: 'the bag shows what the computer has seen before.'</li>
          <li>If time is short, do one round and discuss the idea rather than repeating draws.</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Lesson 3 — Responsible Use & Everyday Decisions (30–45 minutes)</h2>
    <div class="lesson">
      <h3>Learning goals</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Discuss choices about when to use automation and when humans should decide.</li>
        <li>Introduce simple checks: accuracy, explainability, human oversight.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Activity</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Scenario role-play: students act as decision panels for an automated tool (e.g., library book recommender).</li>
        <li>Debrief: what rules would you set? When should a human step in?</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Teacher notes</h3>
      <p class="notes">Emphasise values like fairness, transparency and human judgement. Offer extension tasks for older classes (research local AI systems).</p>
