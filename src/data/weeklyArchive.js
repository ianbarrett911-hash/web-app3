      <p class="mb-4">
        The conversation about Artificial Intelligence is often framed as a contest: who will replace whom? A better question is how humans
        and AI can coevolve—each amplifying the other's strengths—while safeguarding the values that make life worth living.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1) Complementary Strengths</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Humans:</strong> context, judgment, empathy, creativity, and ethics.</li>
        <li><strong>AI:</strong> scale, speed, pattern recognition, memory, and tireless iteration.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">
        When combined intentionally—like clinicians using AI for triage or educators using AI for personalization—we see better outcomes than either alone.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2) Collaboration by Design</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">Effectively integrating AI requires choices:</p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Transparent Interfaces:</strong> Explain what AI is doing and why.</li>
        <li><strong>Human-in-the-Loop:</strong> Keep meaningful human oversight for impactful decisions.</li>
        <li><strong>Feedback Loops:</strong> Let people correct and teach systems to reduce bias and error over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3) Care as a Core Principle</h3>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Care means prioritizing human safety, agency, and flourishing. It implies adopting guardrails (privacy, robustness, red-teaming) and centering
        vulnerable groups in design and governance.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">4) Practical Next Steps</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Workers:</strong> Learn prompt patterns, data literacy, and critical evaluation.</li>
        <li><strong>Leaders:</strong> Define acceptable use, invest in training, measure outcomes beyond productivity.</li>
        <li><strong>Policymakers:</strong> Incentivize safe deployment, fund skills transitions, and support open evaluation.</li>
      </ul>
