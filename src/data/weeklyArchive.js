      <p class="mb-4">
        Artificial intelligence is no longer an academic experiment: in 2025 it’s reshaping workplaces, public services, media ecosystems and even national policy.
        For citizens, policymakers and civil society the key question is no longer <em>will</em> AI matter, but <em>how</em> — and who gets to shape that future.
        Below are the trends to watch and concrete implications for society. <span class="text-sm text-blue-800">(Sources include Stanford HAI)</span>
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-3">
        <li>
          <strong>Autonomous agents — AI that acts, not only responds.</strong>
          <div>
            We’re seeing rapid focus on agentic AI: systems that can take multi-step actions (booking, negotiating, executing tasks) on behalf of users or organisations.
            Businesses see productivity gains, but agents also raise new liability, oversight and alignment challenges when decisions are taken with minimal human oversight. <span class="text-sm text-blue-800">(Reuters)</span>
          </div>
          <div class="text-sm text-blue-900">Why it matters: agents can multiply small errors into large harms if they access systems or make purchases — governance and audit trails become essential.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multimodal models — the converging senses of AI.</strong>
          <div>
            Large models that combine text, images, audio and video are becoming baseline capability. Interfaces get more natural — but deepfake risks and surveillance expand, and bias testing grows more complex when outputs mix modalities. <span class="text-sm text-blue-800">(Times of AI)</span>
          </div>
          <div class="text-sm text-blue-900">Practical implication: multimodal tools will enter classrooms, healthcare triage, and media production — insist on transparency and provenance.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Regulation is catching up — but unevenly.</strong>
          <div>
            The EU’s AI rulebook is rolling out and national laws are following suit (with some stricter national measures in 2025). Companies face pressure on transparency, copyright, and risk assessments — even as many urge phased enforcement for clarity. <span class="text-sm text-blue-800">(Reuters)</span>
          </div>
          <div class="text-sm text-blue-900">Policy takeaway: expect a patchwork of rules across jurisdictions; cross-border coordination and standards will be a major battleground.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Trust, alignment and value choice.</strong>
          <div>
            With more autonomous and powerful systems, the social question becomes: whose values are embedded in AI? Debates about value alignment, redress, and meaningful human oversight shape everything from content moderation to health diagnostics.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Energy, supply chains and the carbon bill of AI.</strong>
          <div>
            Compute demand is driving data‑centre expansion and large energy use. Analyses indicate AI could account for a far larger share of data‑centre power by 2030, creating environmental trade‑offs that intersect with geopolitics and local communities. <span class="text-sm text-blue-800">(Carbon Brief)</span>
          </div>
          <div class="text-sm text-blue-900">What to watch: pressure for energy‑efficient models, greener data‑centre policies, and local impact assessments as part of procurement.</div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Work and economic shifts — adaptation not just replacement.</strong>
          <div>
            Workers report productivity gains with AI, but large‑scale transitions will require retraining, safety nets, and job redesign to avoid widening inequality. Governments and employers face an urgent re‑skilling challenge. <span class="text-sm text-blue-800">(OECD)</span>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Shadow AI and enterprise risk.</strong>
          <div>
            Teams increasingly use third‑party tools without IT approval. This introduces data‑leak risk, compliance gaps and reputational issues — companies must invest in governance, not just capability. <span class="text-sm text-blue-800">(Reuters)</span>
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Human rights, disinformation and democratic resilience.</strong>
          <div>
            Synthetic media and targeted persuasion amplify disinformation risks. Protecting elections, privacy and minority rights requires watermarking/provenance, civic literacy and legal frameworks.
          </div>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>AI for public good — cautious optimism.</strong>
          <div>
            AI is delivering benefits in healthcare, education and public administration when designed inclusively and with oversight. Governments and the OECD are issuing guidance for responsible public‑sector AI — expect adoption to accelerate under new guardrails. <span class="text-sm text-blue-800">(OECD)</span>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Medical Technology Is Quietly Getting Great</h2>
      <p class="italic text-blue-700 mb-4">Estimated reading time: 7 minutes</p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        Healthcare doesn’t change overnight—but in 2025, AI is finally delivering pragmatic upgrades
        patients and clinicians can feel. The biggest improvements are not sci‑fi; they’re the
        invisible fixes that remove friction, surface risks earlier, and return time to care.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">1) Local AI that helps today</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Ambient scribing:</strong> On‑device or private cloud models now draft encounter notes,
        orders, and patient instructions automatically. Clinicians review and sign—saving 1‑2 hours per day.</li>
        <li><strong>Imaging triage:</strong> AI flags likely strokes, pneumothorax, PE, and fractures in minutes,
        prioritizing reads and speeding interventions without replacing radiologists.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk stratification:</strong> Hospital models watch vitals and labs to predict sepsis,
        delirium, and readmission—paging teams earlier and reducing length of stay.</li>
        <li><strong>Patient access:</strong> Chat and voice agents handle refill requests, scheduling,
        pre‑visit intake, and post‑op FAQs with human handoff on edge cases.</li>
      </ul>
      <p class="mb-4">
        These are narrow models with clear guardrails, audit logs, and clinician oversight. They’re not
        replacing expertise—they’re removing busywork and catching issues sooner.
      </p>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">2) AGI‑class planning for care pathways</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">
        As reasoning models improve, the next leap is <em>care orchestration</em>: systems that can plan,
        simulate, and coordinate across multi‑month pathways—diabetes, oncology, heart failure—while
        staying aligned to clinician intent and patient preferences.
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Personalized pathways:</strong> Given guidelines, history, and SDOH data, agents propose
        stepwise plans, verify coverage, book follow‑ups, and adapt as labs and symptoms change.</li>
        <li><strong>Closed‑loop safety:</strong> Every action is paired with uncertainty estimates,
        counterfactual checks, and human approval points for high‑risk steps.</li>
        <li><strong>System‑level gains:</strong> Fewer gaps in care, fewer no‑shows, smoother handoffs,
        and measurable outcome improvements.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">3) Preparing for superhuman assistance</h3>
      <p class="mb-3">
        We don’t need mythical ASI to see risk. As capabilities compound, the right <em>rails</em> matter:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Data governance by default:</strong> Local first where possible, robust PHI controls, and
        differential privacy for research pipelines.</li>
        <li><strong>Model governance:</strong> Versioning, monitoring for drift, red‑teaming, and incident
        response runbooks—treated like clinical quality programs, not side projects.</li>
        <li><strong>Explainability where it counts:</strong> Not every model needs a thesis, but high‑stakes
        decisions demand traceable evidence, alternatives, and uncertainty.</li>
        <li><strong>Human authority:</strong> Clinicians remain accountable. Systems must make it easy to
        override, appeal, and audit.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-2">What this means for you</h3>
      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Patients:</strong> Shorter waits, clearer instructions, fewer repeat visits. Ask your clinic
        if they offer visit summaries and AI‑assisted follow‑ups.</li>
        <li><strong>Clinicians:</strong> Start with ambient scribing and inbox automation; measure time saved
        and error rates. Build toward pathway orchestration with clear outcome goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Health systems:</strong> Treat AI like an operations upgrade—tie deployments to throughput,
        safety, and cost metrics. Invest in governance early.</li>
